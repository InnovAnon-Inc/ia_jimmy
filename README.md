Jimmy Cracked Key
==================


This module serves as a simple entry point with an asynchronous REPL pipeline to demonstrate the single-crack operation of the ia_jimmy module. Bulk operations are also available.


Overview:
---------
The algorithm appears to be designed specifically for cracking RSA keys generated by broken PRNGs, leveraging mathematical techniques such as GCD calculations and factorization. By identifying shared prime factors among multiple RSA keys, the algorithm can exploit weaknesses in key generation to recover private keys.


Relevance:
----------
This approach is particularly relevant in scenarios where RSA keys are not generated securely, making them susceptible to attacks. The implementation reflects a sophisticated understanding of both the mathematical principles underlying RSA and the practical vulnerabilities that can arise from poor cryptographic practices.
